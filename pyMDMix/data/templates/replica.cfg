# GENERAL #

# Comma separated list of solvent box names to be used in the project (e.g. MAM,ETA,WAT). NO DEFAULT. MANDATORY
SOLVENTS = 

# Number of replicas for each solvent (read documentation for advanced options). E.g: 3, WAT:1. DEFAULT:3
#NREPL = 

# Number of nanoseconds to run (advanced configuration in the documentation). E.g: 20, WAT//10. DEFAULT:20
#NANOS = 

# Temperature of each replica (again advanced configuration assigning independent temperatures is possible). E.g.: 300. DEFAULT:300K
#TEMP = 

# Restraining scheme (OPTIONS: HA, FREE, BB for heavyatoms, no-restraints, back-bone atoms). DEFAULT: FREE. Also accepts advanced configuration.
#RESTR= 

# Restraining force when RESTR!=FREE. In kcal/mol.A^2. Default=0.0. Advanced configuration is possible.
#FORCE= 

# Residue mask of residues where restraints should be applied (default: auto detect). E.g.: 1-100
#RESTRMASK = auto

# Residue mask of residues to which backbone atoms we should align the trajectories in analysis process (default: same as restrmask: all protein). E.g.: 1-100
#ALIGNMASK = auto

# SETTINGS OVERRIDE #
#####################
# All parameters present in replica-settings.cfg can be here overriden.

# For instance, if we want to modify the trajectory writing frequency:
# TRAJFREQUENCY =  

# Modify number of steps per run file (step).
# We might be interested in increase the file size to include several nanosecods
# instead of only 1 (the default; 500000 steps with md_timestep of 2fs)
# NVT_PROD_STEPS = 1000000
# NPT_PROD_STEPS = 1000000

# ETC...
